# AI Assistant Settings for solana-accountgen

## Project Overview
solana-accountgen is a Rust utility crate for generating mock Solana accounts for testing purposes. It provides a simple, fluent API for creating accounts with custom balances, owners, and data, making it easier to write tests for Solana programs.

## Code Structure
- **src/lib.rs**: Main library entry point with exports and documentation
- **src/account_builder.rs**: Core AccountBuilder implementation
- **src/error.rs**: Error types and handling
- **src/extensions/**: Optional extensions for specific account types
- **src/serialization/**: Serialization support for different formats
- **src/main.rs**: Optional CLI entry point

## Key Components
- **AccountBuilder**: Fluent API for building mock Solana accounts
- **Serialization**: Support for Borsh and other serialization formats
- **Extensions**: Specialized helpers for token accounts and program testing

## Dependencies
- solana-program: Core Solana program crate
- solana-sdk: Solana SDK for interacting with the blockchain
- solana-program-test: Testing utilities for Solana programs
- borsh: Binary serialization format used by Solana

## Coding Conventions
- Use Rust 2024 edition features
- Follow standard Rust naming conventions
- Implement fluent APIs with builder patterns
- Provide comprehensive error handling
- Document public APIs with examples

## Common Tasks
- Creating mock accounts with specific balances and owners
- Serializing and deserializing account data
- Setting up test environments for Solana programs
- Creating Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests with solana-program-test
- Example code that demonstrates usage patterns
